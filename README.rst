Vue + Django with no compromise. 

Cookiecutter Vue Django is a framework for jumpstarting production-ready Django + Vue projects quickly.  Expanding on the wonderful Cookiecutter Django, this project template allows the intermingling of both Django Templates and Vue, even on the same page, without compromising the full power of either. 

Typical solutions to integrating Django and Vue forgo much of the strengths of one lieu of the other. For example, a common approach is using Django Rest Framework as backend and writing the entire front end in Vue, making it difficult to utilize Django templates in places it could be expedient. A second approach is to use Vue within Django templates using browser `<script>` includes, but then lost is the ability to use Vue's Single File Components.

This project utilizes a different approach, melding these two technologies more naturally. As a result, not only are the typical compromises eliminated, but additional distinct advantages are realized:

* Increased flexibility: The developer is free to use Django Templates or Vue as appropriate, choosing the right tool for the job
* Increased development speed: Reduce time spent fighting the framework by using Django and Vue where each excels
* Increased performance: Leverage Django's powerful caching backend to deliver content-rich pages quickly with little or no Javascript, while deferring complex and interactive Vue functionality until after page load

Note: For informationa about integration with Vue 3, see https://github.com/ilikerobots/cookiecutter-vue-django/issues/13#issuecomment-791915473
